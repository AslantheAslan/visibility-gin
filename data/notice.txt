# About the dataset

CU-ECG dataset is a private dataset which is constructed particularly for biometric authentication applications. Since providing a private dataset will be breaching privacy, we only provided the extracted heart pulses (PQRST segments) for each subject.

combined_pulses.txt includes 1 pulse per 10 second of ECG record.
multi_patients_2.txt includes 2 pulses per 10 second of ECG record.
multi_patients_3.txt includes 3 pulses per 10 second of ECG record.
